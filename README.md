# GWignerfit

GWignerfit is the swiss army knife of experimental quantum chaos for the
analysis (and acquisition) of microwave resonator spectra.

The main purpose is the simultaneous fitting of a large number of Brei-Wigner
shaped resonance curves to the transmission or reflection spectra. From this
various statistical measures such as the nearest-neighbour-distribution can be
calculated and length spectra are accessible by Fourier transform of the data.

For details of its use and purpose please see the detailed manual in the `doc` folder.

GWignerfit is built using C, Gtk and Glib.
